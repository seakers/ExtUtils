# DAKOTA INPUT FILE - dakota_rosenbrock_importance.in
# This file tests the importance sampling capabilities based on LHS. 
# It is may be integrated into another rosenbrock file but for now 
# it is cleanest to have a simple, standalone file. 
# In the current version of the test, all of the different 
# importance_sampling versions (import, adapt_import, and mm_adapt_import) 
# start with 250 samples ("samples = 250"). 
# Then, more samples are added based on the three types of importance sampling.  
# Each time samples are added, 100 samples are added around certain points 
# of interest ("refinement_samples = 100"). 
# In mm_adapt_sampling, 100 points are added around multiple points of interest 
# and the process keeps iteratively updating until it converges, which is why 
# it takes so long. 
# NOTE:  to keep computational costs down, we could add "max_iterations = 5" 
# in the method block for adapt_import and mm_adapt_import.
