//! Conveys trial points through the process of being queued, cached, and evaluated.
/*!
  The conveyor's main interface is the exchange() method.  It takes a (possibly
  empty) list of unevaluated trial points from each citizen, schedules some
  points for evaluation, and returns a merged list of evaluated trial points
  from all citizens.  Scheduled points are removed from citizen queues, and
  may spend time on a "pendingList" before actual evaluation.

  The conveyor is given ownership of an Executor object to perform evaluations
  using full computing resources.

  The conveyor owns a CacheManager to avoid reevaluating "equal" points.
  The ScaledComparison object determines whether two points are "equal".

  Points that are currently in the process of being evaluated by the executor
  are stored in a "pendingList".  When a new point is considered by the conveyor,
  it is sent to the executor only if not found in the cache or pendingList.

  /*!
   *  Each citizen provides a (possibly empty) list of unevaluated points.
   *  Points are removed in order, according to the priority of the citizens.
   *  If multiple citizens have the same priority, then points are interleaved
   *  according to a randomization scheme.  Each point goes to either the
   *  pendingList (for evaluation), the evalList (if already cached),
   *  or the pendingPrime map (if already pending).
   *
   *  The cache and pendingPrime list determine a point to be "equal" by
   *  making a ScaledComparison.
   *
   *  @param[in,out]  ctznQueueLists
   *      List of new trial points to evaluate, one list per citizen.
   *      The list can be empty if citizens are waiting for points in the
   *      pending list.  On exit, each citizen list still contains and owns
   *      points not yet accepted by the conveyor.
   *  @param[out]  evalList
   *      On exit, contains a (possibly empty) list of newly evaluated points.
