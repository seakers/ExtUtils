//! Contains general linear constraints and methods for using them.
/*!
  HOPSPACK can be configured at build time to exclude linking an LAPACK library,
  which means linear constraints cannot be used.  The configuration appears
  in the code as preprocessing symbol HAVE_LAPACK.  However, simple variable
  bounds are also a type of linear constraint, so instances of this
  class can be constructed even if general linear constraints are excluded.

  Consider the following linearly constrained problem
  \f[
    \begin{array}{rlcrcl}
    \displaystyle\mbox{minimize} & \multicolumn{5}{c}{f(x)} \\
    x \in R^n \\
    \mbox{subject to} & b^{\rm lower} & \le & x & \le & b^{\rm upper}\\
    & b^{\rm ineq\_lower} & \le & A^{\rm ineq} x & \le & b^{\rm ineq\_upper} \\
    & & & A^{\rm eq} x & = & b^{\rm eq}
    \end{array}
  \f]
  Note that inequality bounds may be infinite (i.e., unbounded).
  A variable may be fixed by setting identical lower and upper bounds, or by
  defining a linear equality.

  Variables are always scaled and shifted, and linear constraint computations
  are made in the scaled and shifted problem space.
  The scaling vector is denoted by \f$ s \f$, specified in ProblemDef, and
  defined so that all components are positive and finite.
  Variable shifting moves the lower bound to zero.

  Scaled and shifted quantities are:
  \f[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \tilde{x}                   &=& S^{-1}(x - \hat{\ell})  \\
    {\tilde f(\tilde x)}        &=& f(S \tilde x + \hat{\ell}) = f(x) \\
    \tilde{b}^{\rm lower}       &=& S^{-1}(b^{\rm lower} - \hat{\ell}) \\
    \tilde{b}^{\rm upper}       &=& S^{-1}(b^{\rm upper} - \hat{\ell}) \\
    \tilde{b}^{\rm ineq\_lower}
        &=& b^{\rm ineq\_lower} - A^{\rm ineq} \hat{\ell} \\
    \tilde{b}^{\rm ineq\_upper}
        &=& b^{\rm ineq\_upper} - A^{\rm ineq} \hat{\ell} \\
    \tilde{b}^{\rm eq}          &=& b^{\rm eq} - A^{\rm eq} \hat{\ell} \\
    \tilde{A}^{\rm ineq}        &=& A^{\rm ineq} S \\
    \tilde{A}^{\rm eq}          &=& A^{\rm eq} S
    \end{array}
  \f]
  where
  \f[
    S = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
    s_1 \\
    & \ddots \\
    & &  s_n
    \end{array}\right)
  \f]
  \f[
    \hat{\ell}_ = \left\{
      \begin{array}{cl}
      b^{\rm lower}_i & {\rm if } \; b^{\rm lower}_i > -\infty \\
      0 & {\rm otherwise}.
      \end{array}
    \right.
  \f]

  The scaled problem is then given by
  \f[
    \begin{array}{rlcrcl}
    \displaystyle\mbox{minimize} & \multicolumn{5}{c}{\tilde f(\tilde x)} \\
    \tilde x \in R^n \\
    \mbox{subject to}
      & \tilde b^{\rm lower} & \le & \tilde x & \le & \tilde b^{\rm upper} \\
      & \tilde b^{\rm ineq\_lower} & \le & \tilde A^{\rm ineq} \tilde x
          & \le & \tilde b^{\rm ineq\_upper} \\
      & & & \tilde A^{\rm eq} \tilde x & = & \tilde b^{\rm eq}
    \end{array}
  \f]

  Internally, the code combines bound and linear inequality constraints into
  one matrix, giving
  \f[
    \begin{array}{rlcrcl}
    \displaystyle\mbox{minimize} & \multicolumn{5}{c}{\tilde f(\tilde x)} \\
    \tilde x \in R^n \\
    \mbox{subject to}
      & \hat b^{\rm lower} & \le & \hat A^{\rm ineq} \tilde x & \le
          & \hat b^{\rm upper} \\
      & & & \tilde A^{\rm eq} \tilde x & = & \tilde b^{\rm eq}
    \end{array}
  \f]
  where
  \f[
    \begin{array}{ccccc}
    \hat{b}^{\rm lower} = \left(
      \begin{array}{l}
      \tilde{b}^{\rm lower} \\
      \tilde{b}^{\rm ineq\_lower}

    \param[in] maxLength Maximum step length, unscaled.

    On exit a nonnegative scalar \f$ \alpha \f$ is returned 
    that gives the maximum feasible step that can be made

    The method finds all \a blocking \a constraints and then the minimum
    distance to the first such constraint.
    An inequality is a blocking constraint if the search direction has a
    numerically significant component pointing towards its infeasible region.
    Let \f$ \epsilon \f$ be the value returned by getActiveTol().
    An inequality is blocking if it satisfies the following condition:

    \f[

          & a_i^T d & > & \epsilon
      \end{array}
    \f]

    If any blocking inequality constraint is deemed active according to
    getIneqState(), then a value of zero is returned.
    Also, if the search direction d is not in the null space of the equality
    constraints, then a value of zero is returned.
    Otherwise,
    \f[
      \alpha = {\rm min} \left( \{\Delta\} \cup  
      \left\{ \frac{b_i - a_i^T x}{a_i^T d} \Big |\;
          i \in \mathcal{B} \right\} \right)
    \f]
    is returned, where \f$ \mathcal{B} \f$ denotes the set of blocking
    inequality constraints, and \f$ \Delta \f$ is maxLength.

    \note
    Linear algebra roundoff error may cause the step to go slightly beyond
    the variable bounds (as well as slightly off the general linear
    constraints).  Variable bound violations are often considered serious;
    hence, new points computed from the step should be checked using
    isBndsFeasible() in HOPSPACK::ProblemDef.

    The point is scaled, and the distance is computed for the scaled version

    the null space of \f$ \tilde A^{eq} \f$,

     \param[in] esnap Radius of a ball about x that defines "nearby" constraints.

     The primary purpose of this method is to quickly guess a solution point
     at the "corner" of the feasible region.
     Many derivative-free algorithms will "half-step" towards a boundary,
     asymptotically approaching it.  If the solution is on the boundary, then
     convergence to a specified tolerance may take a long time.  Snapping to
     the constraint is faster, and more accurate if the solution is at a corner.

     This method computes the closest point to the current x that satisfies
     all linear constraints lying within the distance esnap.
     If x violates any linear equality constraints, then the method only
     computes a point satisfying the equality constraints.

     The method begins by scaling the variables and determining all "nearby"
     inequality constraints using the argument esnap.
     A matrix \f$ A_{\rm esnap} \f$ is then formed that consists of the rows
     \f$ \tilde A^{Eq} \f$ followed by the rows of \f$ \hat A \f$ that
     correspond to "nearby" constraints.
     An LQ factorization is formed and \f$ A_{\rm esnap} \f$ redefined if
     necessary to have full row rank, based on the value of getActiveTol().
     The corresponding right-hand side vector \f$ b_{\rm esnap} \f$ is
     also formed.

     To find the point, the method solves an equality-constrained linear least
     squares problem and replaces x with the solution \f$ y^{*} \f$:
     \f[
       \begin{array}{cc}
