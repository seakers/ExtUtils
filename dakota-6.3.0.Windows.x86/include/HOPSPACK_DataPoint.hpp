  An instance contains a vector that specifies the location.  If the point
  has been evaluated, then the instance also contains objective function(s)
  and nonlinear constraint results.  Linear constraint results are not
  included.

  Each DataPoint is assigned a unique tag identifier during construction.
  Subclasses should rely on the base class constructor to assign a tag.

  Methods and states for evaluating just F (not FC) are provided for
  simplifying evaluation of problems without nonlinear constraints.
