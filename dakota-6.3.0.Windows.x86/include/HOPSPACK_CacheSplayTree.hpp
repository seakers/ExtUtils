/*! 
  \brief Templated binary storage structure. 

  A templated splay tree. The template takes is based on a
  <em>Comparable</em> class that must support the following five
  operations.

  <ul>
  <li> Empty Constructor

       <tt>Comparable();</tt>

       Called indirectly by splay, which creates a CacheSplayTreeNode that
       doesn't actually have an element in it. 

  <li> Copy Constructor

       <tt>Comparable(const Comparable& source);</tt>

       The copy constructor is used only when insert is called.

  <li> Copy Data

       <tt> void copyData(const Comparable& source);</tt>

       The copy data is used only when find is called and a match is
       found in the splay tree. It is used to copy the relevant data
       from the matching entry to the input to find.
      
  <li> Not Equal

       <tt> bool operator!=(const Comparable& source);</tt>

       This is used only when find is called.

  <li> Less Than 

       <tt> bool operator<(const Comparable& source);</tt>

       This is used by insert and repeatedly by splay.

  <li> Greater Than

       <tt> bool operator>(const Comparable& source);</tt>

       This is used by insert and repeatedly by splay.

  </ul>

  Used only in HOPSPACK::CacheManager.
