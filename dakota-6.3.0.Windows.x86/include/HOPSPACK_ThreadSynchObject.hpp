//! Defines an object for synchronizing execution between threads.
/*!
 *  Threads synchronize by acquiring and releasing ownership of an instance of
 *  this class.  A call to waitForOwnership() will acquire the underlying
 *  monitor (typically a mutex).  Calling notify() will release the monitor
 *  lock and allow a waiting thread to acquire ownership.  To synchronize safely,
 *  the calls use a simple lock with method synchronizeLock(), and a boolean.
 *
 *  Example usage, signaling from thread 1 to thread 2:
 *    ThreadSimpleLock   cLock
 *    cLock.releaseLock
 *    bool  b2needsToSynch = false
 *    ThreadSynchObject  cSynchObj (cLock, *b2needsToSynch)
 *    thread 1:
 *      loop
 *        ...set up for message to thread 2
 *        cSynchObj.notify
 *        ...possibly wait for a synchronizing reply
 *        cSynchObj.takeOwnership
 *    thread 2 (cSynchObj):
 *      loop
 *        cSynchObj.waitForNotify
 *        b2needsToSynch = true
 *        ...process message from thread 1
 *        cSynchObj.synchronizeLock
 *        b2needsToSynch = false
 *  In the example, the lock ensures thread 1 will have ownership before
 *  thread 2 calls waitForOwnership.  The boolean ensures thread 1 does not
 *  notify until thread 2 calls synchronizeLock.
 *
 *  The Windows implementation uses an interprocess WINAPI Event object.
 *  Since there is only one process, the lightweight WINAPI Critical Section
 *  was considered; however, Critical Sections do not allow a single atomic
 *  wait over a set of objects, and do not support waiting with a timeout.
 *
 *  The Unix implementation uses a condition variable with associated mutex
 *  and boolean.  The mutex serves only to safeguard updating of the boolean.
 *  Other external locks are used for thread synchronization.
 *  I must admit there might be a simpler implementation of thread
 *  synchronization (on both platforms) using external condition variables.

     *                          lock per instance.
