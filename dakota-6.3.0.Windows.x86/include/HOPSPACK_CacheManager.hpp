/*! 
  \brief Manages cached points efficiently.

  The cache supports the ability to read and/or write cached function
  values from files.  Each line corresponds to one point and its values.
  A typical single line may look like the following.

  \verbatim
  x=[ 0.0000e+00 -1.2500e-02  ] f=[ 3.1250e-04 ] ceq=[ (empty)] cineq=[ (empty) ]
  \endverbatim

  The line is parsed as follows:
  <ul>
  <li> The line must begin with "x=[".
  <li> This is followed by a minimum of one space.
  <li> Entries of x, separated by spaces, are read until "]" is
       encountered, surrounded by white space.
  <li> This is followed by a minimum of one space.
  <li> The next characters are "f=[".
  <li> This is followed by a minimum of one space.
  <li> Entries of f, separated by spaces, are read until "]" is
       encountered, surrounded by white space.  The single entry "(empty)"
       is allowed, meaning that f has no value.
  <li> The next characters are "ceq=[".
  <li> Another vector of entries follows for nonlinear equality constraints,
       following the same format as "f=[".
  <li> The next characters are "cineq=[".
  <li> Another vector of entries follows for nonlinear inequality constraints,
       following the same format as "f=[".
  </ul>

  Any line that does not conform to the above format is ignored.
  Comments are not allowed, but empty lines can be inserted to delimit sections.
