  \brief Function to call CDDLIB for computing cone generators.

  \param[out] num_pointy  The number of generators for the "pointy
                          part" of the tangent cone.

  \param[out] P  On exit, *P points to a (num_pointy x n) matrix
   stored in double** format whose rows form a positive spanning set
   for the "pointy part" of the tangent cone.  That is, *P[i] points
   to a double array of length n.  If we define \f$p_i\f$ to be the
   mathematical vector stored in *P[i], then \f$\{p_1,\ldots,p_{\rm
   num\_pointy}\}\f$ generates the pointy part of the space.

  \param[out] num_lineality  The number of vectors in a basis for
                             the lineality space of the tangent cone.

  \param[out] L  On exit, *L points to a (num_lineality x n) matrix
  stored in double** format whose rows form a basis for th lineality
  space of the tangent cone.  That is, *L[i] points to a double array
  of length n.  If we define \f$\ell_i\f$ to be the mathematical
  vector store in *L[i], then \f$\{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_{\rm
  num\_lineality}\}\f$ forms a basis for the lineality space.

  \param[in] n   The array length, a.k.a. the length of array Eq[i]
                 and Iq[i], a.k.a, the number of columns in Eq and Iq.

  \param[in] num_equalities  Number of rows in Eq.  

  \param[in] Eq  A (num_equalities x n) matrix stored in double** format whose
                 rows span the lineality space of the normal cone.

  \param[in] num_inequalities  Number of rows in Iq.

  \param[in] Iq  A (num_inequalities x n) matrix stored in double** format whose
                 rows generate the "pointy part" of the normal cone. 

  \param[in] append  Used as a logical operator to signal whether or not
                     P and L are already partially formed and being appended to.
  \return 0 if successful.

  Caution:  Memory for arguments P and L is allocated internally 
  within compute_cone_generators()
  "c-style", and must therefore be deallocated "c-style" externally.
