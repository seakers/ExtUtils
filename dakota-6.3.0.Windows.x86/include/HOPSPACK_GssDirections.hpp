//! Generate and manage GSS search directions and associated information.
/*!  
  This object generates an appropriate set of search directions from a given
  "new best point", then tracks and updates the associated step lengths as
  the search from that progresses.  A new set of directions is initialized
  when computeNewDirections() is called.

  For each direction, track the desired step length, the true step length
  (if the desired step is outside the feasible region, then correct with a
  step length that maintains feasibility), and the trial point tag to the step.
  An internal cache of directions is maintained for greater efficiency.

  The true step and tag are actually calculated by
  GssIterator::generateTrialPoints().

  If the problem contains general linear constraints (as opposed to simple
  variable bounds), then the solution requires access to an LAPACK library.
  If constraints become nearly degenerate at a point, then the CDD library
  can be called to improve robustness and performance.

  /*! \brief Computes a new set of search directions based on a new best point.

    Search directions are computed by one of three private member functions:
    - buildWithNothing(),
    - buildWithLapack() (requires LAPACK library),
    - buildWithCddLib() (requires CDD library).

    If only bound constraints are present, search direction are computed
    exclusively by buildWithNothing().  
    If general linear constraints are present, a call is first made
    to buildNormalCone().  This method returns the following:
    - either a boolean value of true signifying that search directions for
      the current normal cone have already been generated and is stored
      in private member \e directionCache, or
    - a boolean value of false and the current normal cone.

    If the search directions are already in directionCache, computeNewDirections()
    returns these directions.
    If buildNormalCone() returns false, search directions must be computed.

   \b Computing \b new \b search \b directions:

   generateUnconstrained() is called whenever the problem looks locally
   unconstrained, i.e. the normal cone \f$ = \{ \emptyset \} \f$.
   Otherwise the search directions are computed with buildWithLapack()
   if possible.  If buildWithLapack() is unsuccessful (this can happen if
   nearby constraints are degenerate), then buildWithCddLib() is called.

   Finally, if user parameter "Add Projected Normals" is true, the projected
   normals are also added to the list of search directions.

   On exit the set of newly computed search direction are added to the direction  
   cache and the current search directions are updated.

    computeNewDirections() also resets the step information.
    The initial step (which is the same for all directions) is calculated as
    \f[
    \Delta_{\rm new} = \max \{ \Delta_{\rm old}, \Delta_{\min} \}.
    \f]
    Here, \f$\Delta_{\min}\f$ is minStep.
  */
  void computeNewDirections(const GssPoint& newPoint);

  //! Adds new directions when point remains the same but step is reduced.
  /*! The purpose of appendNewDirections is to handle the case when the step size
      is reduced.  Because HOPSPACK is asynchronous, the step size may be reduced
      for a given direction before the current point is rejected.  In a sense, we
      do not know yet if \f$ x_{k+1} = x_k \f$, signifying a failed iteration, or
      if a new best point will be found.  For failed iterations, the current
      point remains the same and the step size is reduced.  Reducing the step
      size may alter the relevant tangent cone, i.e. fewer constraints will be
      seen as blocking, increasing the number of relevant search directions.
      Thus, to remain theoretically convergent, trial-points must be appended to
      the queue corresponding to these new directions in the advent that the
      current iteration fails.  For this reason, appendNewDirections() will be
      called each time the reduced step
      \f$ \hat \Delta_{k}^i \f$ corresponding to the ith direction \f$d_i\f$
      satisfies
      \f[
         \hat \Delta_{k}^i < \min_{ 1 \le i \le n_d} \Delta_k^i
      \f]
      where \f$ n_d = \f$ equals the number of search directions.
