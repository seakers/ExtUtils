 *  The constructing thread owns the original lock.  Two threads should

 *  The Windows implementation uses the lightweight WINAPI Critical Section.
 *  It is simple and fast, but does not provide a single atomic wait over
 *  a set of lock, or waiting with a timeout.
 *  Every entry into a Critical Section must be paired with a leave; ie,
 *  the operating system counts each entry and leave.
