//! Interface for algorithms that generate a set of start points.
/*! Generator algorithms effectively control the multi-start process by
 *  deciding on a sequence of start points.
 *
 *  When the GSS-MS citizen calls a point generator method, all main thread
 *  processing by HOPSPACK waits for the method to return.  Therefore, a
 *  point generator requiring excessive CPU time should offload the work
 *  using an asynchronous citizen worker.
 *
 *  An interface design makes it easy for users to extend HOPSPACK with their
 *  own multi-start generator.  New implementations must subclass this class
 *  and become registered by modifying the "newInstance" method.
