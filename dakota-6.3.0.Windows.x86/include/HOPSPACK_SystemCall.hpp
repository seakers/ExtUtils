//----------------------------------------------------------------------
//! Implements Evaluator to get information by calling an application executable.
/*!
 *  The implementation must be compatible with serial, MPI, and multithreaded
 *  versions of HOPSPACK.
 *
 *  System call finds the name of a user-supplied executable from user parameters.
 *  A single point is evaluated by writing arguments to a uniquely named file,
 *  making a system call to run the executable as a separate process, and
 *  reading results from another uniquely named file.  The two files are
 *  deleted after results are read and stored by HOPSPACK.
 *
 *  File names are of the form "user_specified_prefix.NNN_TT", where NNN
 *  is a unique integer tag, and TT is the type of information requested.
 *  This information is also passed to the evaluation executable in case
 *  it needs to create uniquely named temporary files.
 *
 *  The input file begins with the SS request code on the first line, and then
 *  the point at which to compute the evaluation.  The point, like all vectors,
 *  is formatted with each component on a separate line, as a floating point
 *  number in exponential notation, with the number of significant digits
 *  determined by a configuration parameter.
 *
 *  The output file, if evaluation was successful, begins with the number
 *  of objectives returned and then their values.  This is followed by the
 *  number of nonlinear equality constraints and their values, and then the
 *  same for nonlinear inequalities.  If there are no nonlinear constraints,
 *  then both parts can be skipped.  If there are only one kind of nonlinear
 *  constraint, the missing type should write a zero in the output file.
 *
 *  Linear constraints need not be evaluated and should not be reported
 *  (citizens already know about them from configuration parameters).
 *  If evaluation was unsuccessful, then the output file should contain a
 *  simple text error message that is passed on.
