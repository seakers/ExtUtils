//! Performs a single GSS iteration using reverse communication.

  The constructor reads the following parameters from the user inputs.

  <li>"Initial Step"
  <li>"Snap To Boundary"
  <li>"Snap Distance"
  <li>"Sufficient Improvement Factor"
  <li>"Use Random Order"

  The class GssIterator is capable of performing a single GSS iteration.
  Communication with an external driving class is performed via the method
  pointExchange().  Essentially, pointExchange() inputs a list of evaluated
  points and outputs a list of points it wishes evaluated.  This process
  continues until the GssIterator "converges" or is stopped externally.
