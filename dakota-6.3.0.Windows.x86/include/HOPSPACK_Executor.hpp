//! Interface that coordinates execution of evaluations.
/*!
 *  Declare an abstract class interface for execution of evaluations.
 *  Implementations will make optimal use of computing resources to evaluate
 *  many points.  Clients can call submit() any number of times, and interlace
 *  calls to recv() at any time.  The submit() call may block, but not if a
 *  prior call to isReadyForWork() returned true.  The recv() call may block
 *  waiting for evaluation results, but not if isReadyForWork() returns true.
 *
 *  An interface design makes it easy to extend HOPSPACK with an Executor
 *  implementation specialized for a particular computing architecture.
 *  New implementations must subclass Executor, implement all methods, and
 *  be used in a new "main()" program that constructs and uses an instance
 *  of HOPSPACK::Hopspack.
