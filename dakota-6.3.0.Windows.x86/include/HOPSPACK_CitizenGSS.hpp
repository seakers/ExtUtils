//----------------------------------------------------------------------
//! Implements Citizen using Generating Set Search (GSS).
/*! This Citizen solves optimization problems with continuous variables,
 *  variable bounds, and linear constraints.  It does not require or use
 *  derivatives.  The GSS algorithm is guaranteed to find a local stationary
 *  point under mild problem assumptions.
 *
 *  Starting from an initial feasible point, GSS produces a set of feasible
 *  trial points within a "step size" of the current best point.  Evaluated
 *  points can be accepted in any order, and the algorithm is well-suited
 *  for asynchronous parallel architectures.  GSS can accept "better"
 *  points found by other algorithms and will adjust its search accordingly.

     *  The citizen sees all new result points since the last call to this
     *  method.  The "exchange" happens implicitly:  after all citizens have
     *  viewed the newly evaluated points, then the Mediator erases them.
     *  The cOwnerTags parameter allows the citizen to find the subset
     *  of results matching previous requests that it made.
     *
     *  GSS performs the following tasks:
     *  <ul>
     *  <li> The cReturnList is first copied to an internal exchangeList.
     *       If a point is from another citizen, then the copy appears as though
     *       it has no GSS parent.
     *  <li> Infeasible points are removed from the internal list
     *       (for efficiency, only infeasible points with a better objective
     *       value are removed).
     *  <li> The internal list is then sent to GssIterator, which replaces
     *       the newly evaluated points with new trial points.  These are
     *       copied to the cWaitList.
     *  <li> The internal exchangeList is pruned (all points deleted).
     *  </ul>
     *
     *  @param[in] cReturnList  Input list of newly evaluated points.
     *  @param[in] cOwnerTags   List containing the tags of points in cReturnList
     *                          that this citizen owns.
     *  @param[out] cWaitList   Output list of trial points that will be added
     *                          to the wait queue.  Points will be evaluated
     *                          in this order, starting from the back.
