//! Provides a method for solving the linear constraint projection problem.
/*!
 *  The goal is to find the nearest feasible point to a given point \f$ y \f$
 *  that satisfies all linear constraints.  Mathematically:
 *
 *  \f[
 *    \begin{array}{ccl}
 *      \mbox{minimize} & || y - x ||_2  \\
 *      \mbox{s.t.}     & A_{eq} x = b_{eq}
 *                          &  \mbox{(linear equalities)}  \\
 *                      & A_{ineq} x >= b_{ineq}
 *                          &  \mbox{(linear inequalities)}  \\
 *                      & b_{up} >= x >= b_{lo}
 *                          &  \mbox{(variable bounds)}
 *    \end{array}
 *  \f]
 *
 *  All variables are assumed continuous.
 *
 *  There are many possible ways to solve the problem.  The default
 *  implementation is a standard active set method that solves equality
 *  constrained subproblems using LAPACK dgglse.  Thus, computations use
 *  dense matrices and performance does not scale well for large numbers
 *  of variables.  Furthermore, the algorithm assumes linear independence
 *  of the active set of constraints at the solution and all intermediate
 *  iterates.
