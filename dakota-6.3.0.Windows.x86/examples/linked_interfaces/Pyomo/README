Dakota/Pyomo: Running Dakota on an algebraic model defined in Pyomo,
via conversion to AMPL file

This example uses the rosenbrock algebraic test problem.

1. Obtain and install Pyomo; see https://software.sandia.gov/trac/coopr/

2. Obtain and install Dakota; see http://dakota.sandia.gov/

3. Run pyomo2dakota on model.py, resulting in model.nl, model.col,
model.row, and model.dak, for example:

  pyomo2dakota rosenbrock.py

or

  pyomo2dakota diet1.py diet.dat

4. Dakota input file variable and response fragments will be written
to model.dak.  These need to be reviewed and integrated into a Dakota
optimization input file.  This example includes dakota_rosenbrock.in
and dakota_diet1.in as examples of complete input files that integrate
these fragments.
