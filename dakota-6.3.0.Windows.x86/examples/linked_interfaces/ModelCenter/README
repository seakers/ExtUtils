1. INTRODUCTION

This library allows DAKOTA to use ModelCenter to perform computational
simulations for optimization and uncertainy estimation. The library is
a wrapper for a subset of ModelCenter's COM API.  The ModelCenter
interface can be selected using the direct application interface
within the DAKOTA input file. An example can be found at
Dakota/tutorial/Examples/dakota_rosen_suzuki_conmin.in.
Currently the library can only be used with a DAKOTA Cygwin build on
a Windows platform.  ModelCenter 4.1 or higher is required.  The library
has also been ported to SGI to be used with ModelCenter 4.0 SGI release.
If you need this capability, please contact Phoenix Integration, Inc.
