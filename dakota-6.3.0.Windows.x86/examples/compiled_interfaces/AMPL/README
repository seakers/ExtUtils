The makefile compiles and links dakampl, an analysis_driver for
DAKOTA that uses objectives and constraints expressed in AMPL
(see http://www.ampl.com).  Student versions of AMPL suffice
for small examples and can be freely downloaded;
see http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS .

Files rosenbr.mod and textbook.mod are AMPL versions of the
"Rosenbrock" and "textbook" example problems.

File dakamplprob.nl comes from invoking

	ampl -ogdakamplprob rosenbr.mod

and file textbook.nl similarly comes from invoking

	ampl -ogtextbook textbook.mod

To run DAKOTA on the Rosenbrock example, invoke

	dakota rosenbrock.in

For the textbook example, it is necessary to set shell
variable DAKAMPLPROB to textbook.  With the Bourne shell,
you can invoke

	DAKAMPLPROB=textbook dakota textbook.in

With csh, you can invoke

	setenv DAKAMPLPROB textbook
	dakota textbook.in

To compile and link dakampl, simply invoke

	make

You may first need to make minor changes to "makefile"
to adjust it to your system.  See the comments therein.
