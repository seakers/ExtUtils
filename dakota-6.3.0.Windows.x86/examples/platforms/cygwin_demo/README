DAKOTA Cygwin Demo Package

See the file INSTALL.cygwin for general guidance using the Cygwin
version of DAKOTA.  In particular, this demonstration assumes that the
dakota.exe binary and the rosenbrock.exe test driver are available via
the present PATH.  For example, if running in a command prompt:

  set PATH=C:\Dakota\bin;C:\Dakota\test;%PATH%

The Python script demonstration assumes that python.exe is available
at the command prompt as well.
